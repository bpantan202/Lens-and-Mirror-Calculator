# Lens-and-Mirror-Calculator

## Objective
This program called “Lens and Mirror Calculator” is a program that I created because 
I saw the most of my classmates can't understand glass and optics in Physics. 
From the questionnaire, I found that some of the friends were unable to check the answer while doing the problem. 
So I came up with this program to facilitate the verification of answers.

## Principle
The principle of this program is that at the beginning the program will show the basic knowledge of glass and lenses to the user. Then, ask for various known information. Then the system will use those information to calculate the value according to the set formula. If there is insufficient information, the system will calculate the remaining values and show them. But if the user fills in all values, it will check whether the data is correct or not instead.

## How to run this program

> You can run in Lens-and-Mirror-Calculator.py file.
