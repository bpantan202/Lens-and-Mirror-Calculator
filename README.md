# Lens-and-Mirror-Calculator

This program called “Lens and Mirror Calculator” is a program that I created because 
I saw the most of my classmates can't understand glass and optics in Physics. 
From the questionnaire, I found that some of the friends were unable to check the answer while doing the problem. 
So I came up with this program to facilitate the verification of answers.
